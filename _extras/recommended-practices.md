Below are a set of recommended good practices to keep in mind when writing a
Common Workflow Language description for a tool or workflow. These guidelines
are presented for consideration on a scale of usefulness: more is better, not
all are required.

&#9744; No `type: string` parameters for names of input or reference
files/directories; use `type: File` or `type: Directory` as appropriate.

&#9744; Include a license that allows for re-use by anyone, e.g.
[Apache 2.0][apache-license]. If possible, the license should be specified with
its corresponding [SPDX identifier][spdx]. Construct the metadata field for the
licence by providing a URL of the form `https://spdx.org/licenses/[SPDX-ID]`
where `SPDX-ID` is the taken from the list of identifiers linked above. See the
example snippet below for guidance. For non-standard licenses without an SPDX
identifier, provide a URL to the license.

_Example of metadata field for license with SPDX identifier:_
~~~
$namespaces:
  s: https://schema.org/
s:license: https://spdx.org/licenses/Apache-2.0
# other s: declarations
~~~
{: .source}

For more examples of providing metadata within CWL descriptions, see the
[Metadata and Authorship section]({{ page.root }}{% link _episodes/17-metadata.md %})
of this User Guide.

&#9744; Include [attribution information][license-example] for the author(s) of
the CWL tool or workflow description. Use  unambiguous identifiers like
[ORCID][orcid].

&#9744; In tool descriptions, list dependencies using short name(s) under
`SoftwareRequirement`.

&#9744; Include [SciCrunch][scicrunch-issue] identifiers for dependencies in
`https://identifiers.org/rrid/RRID:SCR_NNNNNN` format.

&#9744; All `input` and `output` identifiers should reflect their conceptual
identity. Use informative names like `unaligned_sequences`, `reference_genome`,
`phylogeny`, or `aligned_sequences` instead of  `foo_input`, `foo_file`,
`result`, `input`, `output`, and so forth.

&#9744; In tool descriptions, include a list of version(s) of the tool that are
known to work with this description under `SoftwareRequirement`.

&#9744; `format` should be specified for all input and output `File`s.
Bioinformatics tools should use format identifiers from [EDAM][edam-example].
See also `iana:text/plain`, `iana:text/tab-separated-values` with
`$namespaces: { iana: "https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/" }`.
[Full IANA media type list][iana-types] (also known as MIME types). For
non-bioinformatics tools use or build an appropriate ontology/controlled
vocabulary in the same way. Please edit this page to let us know about it.

&#9744; Mark all input and output `File`s that are read from or written to in a
streaming compatible way (only once, no random-access), as `streamable: true`.

&#9744; Each `CommandLineTool` description should focus on a single operation
only, even if the (sub)command is capable of more. Don't overcomplicate your
tool descriptions with options that you don't need/use.

&#9744; Custom types should be defined with one external YAML per type
definition for re-use.

&#9744; Include a top level short `label` summarising the tool/workflow.

&#9744; If useful, include a top level `doc` as well. This should provide a
longer, more detailed description than was provided in the top level `label`
(see above).

&#9744; Use `type: enum` instead of `type: string` for elements with a fixed
list of valid values.

&#9744; Evaluate all use of JavaScript for possible elimination or replacement.
One common example: manipulating `File` names and paths? Consider whether one
of the [built in `File` properties][file-prop] like `basename`, `nameroot`,
`nameext`, etc, could be used instead.

&#9744; Give the tool description to a colleague (preferably at a different
institution) to test and provide feedback.

&#9744; Complex workflows with individual components which can be abstracted
should utilise the [`SubworkflowFeatureRequirement`][subworkflow] to make their
workflow modular and allow sections of them to be easily reused.

&#9744; Software containers should be made to be conformant to the ["Recommendations for the packaging and containerizing of bioinformatics software"][containers] (also useful to other disciplines).
