# Capturing Standard Output

To capture a tool's standard output stream, add the `stdout` field with
the name of the file where the output stream should go.  Then add `type:
stdout` on the corresponding output parameter.

*stdout.cwl*

```{literalinclude} /_includes/cwl/05-stdout/stdout.cwl
:language: cwl
```

*echo-job.yml*

```{literalinclude} /_includes/cwl/05-stdout/echo-job.yml
:language: yaml
```

Now invoke `cwl-runner` providing the tool wrapper and the input object
on the command line:

```bash
$ cwl-runner stdout.cwl echo-job.yml
[job stdout.cwl] /tmp/tmpE0gTz7$ echo \
    'Hello world!' > /tmp/tmpE0gTz7/output.txt
[job stdout.cwl] completed success
{
    "example_out": {
        "location": "file:///home/me/cwl/user_guide/output.txt",
        "basename": "output.txt",
        "class": "File",
        "checksum": "sha1$47a013e660d408619d894b20806b1d5086aab03b",
        "size": 13,
        "path": "/home/me/cwl/user_guide/output.txt"
    }
}
Final process status is success
```
