## Navigating the User Guide

If you are a beginner user get started with the [Quick Start](/quick-start.md),
[Prerequisites](/prerequisites.md), and the [Basic Concepts](/basic-concepts.md)
sections. For advanced users the subsections of the
[Core Concepts](/core-concepts/index.md) have detailed information about the
most common topics for CWL.

The Table of Contents is displayed at the top menu and also on the left sidebar.
It also appears further down this page but with links to subsections. The right
sidebar contains links to the sections of each page, and the Search form is on
the left sidebar.
