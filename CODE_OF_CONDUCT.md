The CWL Project is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for
everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual

We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

This code of conduct applies to all CWL Project spaces, including the Google

Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from
these spaces at the discretion of the leadership team.
