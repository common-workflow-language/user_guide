Workflow developers should be aware that the usual rules of software licensing apply to this document. For example, if the workflow is shared publicly, licensing terms must be clear so that a future user understands under what conditions they can run the workflow, modify it and/or combine it with other workflows. For this reason, please consider including a license field in the document. The authors of this guide urge you to choose a pre-existing license rather than trying to write your own (see the link below to learn more about choosing a license), and our recommended practice is to choose a license that allows for re-use by anyone, e.g. [Apache 2.0][apache-license]."
