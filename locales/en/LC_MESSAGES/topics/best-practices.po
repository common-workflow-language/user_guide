"The following are a set of recommended good practices to keep in mind "
"when writing a Common Workflow Language description for a tool or "
"workflow. These guidelines are presented for consideration on a scale of "
"usefulness: although more is better, not all are required."

"A CWL document (in conjunction with any external components like "
"`Dockerfile`s) is software code. Workflow developers should be aware that"
" the usual rules of software licensing apply to this document. For "
"example, if the workflow is shared publicly, licensing terms must be "
"clear so that a future user understands under what conditions they can "
"run the workflow, modify it and/or combine it with other workflows. For "
"this reason, please consider including a license field in the document. "
"The authors of this guide urge you to choose a pre-existing license "
"rather than trying to write your own (see the link below to learn more "
"about choosing a license), and our recommended practice is to choose a "
"license that allows for re-use by anyone, e.g. [Apache 2.0][apache-"
"license]."
