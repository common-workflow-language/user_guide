"Normally, input files are located in a read-only directory separate from "
"the output directory.  This causes problems if the underlying tool "
"expects to write its output files alongside the input file in the same "
"directory.  You use `InitialWorkDirRequirement` to stage input files into"
" the output directory. In this example, we use a JavaScript expression to"
" extract the base name of the input file from its leading directory path."
