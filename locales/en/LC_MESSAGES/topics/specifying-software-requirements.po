"Often, tool descriptions will be written for a specific version of a "
"software. To make it easier for others to use your descriptions, you can "
"include a `SoftwareRequirement` field in the `hints` section. This may "
"also help to avoid confusion about which version of a tool the "
"description was written for."

"Depending on your CWL runner, these hints may be used to check that the "
"required software is installed and available before the job is run. To "

"As well as a version number, a unique resource identifier (URI) for the "
"tool is given in the form of an [RRID][rrid]. Resources with RRIDs can be"
" looked up in the [SciCrunch][scicrunch] registry, which provides a "
"portal for finding, tracking, and referring to scientific resources "
"consistently. If you want to specify a tool as a `SoftwareRequirement`, "
"search for the tool on SciCrunch and use the RRID that it has been "
"assigned in the registry. (Follow this [Adding a Resource Tutorial"
"][scicrunch-add-tool] to add a tool to SciCrunch). You can use this RRID "
"to refer to the tool (via [identifiers.org][identifiers]) in the `specs` "
"field of your requirement description. Other good choices, in order of "
"preference, are to include the DOI for the main tool citation and the URL"
" to the tool."
