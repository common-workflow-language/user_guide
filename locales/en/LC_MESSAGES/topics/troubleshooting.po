"You can use the `--cachedir` option when running a workflow to tell "
"`cwltool` to cache intermediate files (files that are not input nor "
"output files, but created while your workflow is running). By default, "
"these files are created in a temporary directory but writing them to a "
"separate directory makes accessing them easier."

"In the following example `troubleshooting-wf1.cwl` we have two steps, "
"`step_a` and `step_b`. The workflow is equivalent to `echo \"Hello "
"World\" | rev`, which would print the message \"Hello World\" reversed, "
"i.e. \"dlroW olleH\". However, the second step, `step_b`, **has a typo**,"
" where instead of executing the `rev` command it tries to execute `revv`,"
" which fails."

"In this example the workflow step `step_a` was not re-evaluated as it had"
" been cached, and there was no change in its execution or output. "
"Furthermore, `cwltool` was able to recognize when it had to re-evaluate "
"`step_b` after we fixed the executable name. This technique is useful for"
" troubleshooting your CWL documents and also as a way to prevent "
"`cwltool` to re-evaluate steps unnecessarily."
