"Implementation extensions not required for correct execution (for "
"example, fields related to GUI presentation) and metadata about the tool "
"or workflow itself (for example, authorship for use in citations) may be "
"provided as additional fields on any object. Such extensions fields (e.g."
" `format: edam:format_2572`) can use a namespace prefix listed in the "
"`$namespaces` section of the document (e.g. edam: "
"http://edamontology.org/) as described in the [Schema Salad specification"
"][schema-salad]. Once you add the namespace prefix, you can access it "
"anywhere in the document as shown below. Otherwise, one must use full "
"URLs: `format: http://edamontology.org/format_2572`."
