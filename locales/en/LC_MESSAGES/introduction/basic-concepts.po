"This section describes the basic concepts for users to get started on "
"working with Common Workflow Language (CWL) workflows. Readers are "
"expected to be familiar with workflow managers, YAML, and comfortable "
"with following instructions for the command-line. The other sections of "
"the user guide cover the same concepts, but in more detail. If you are "
"already familiar with CWL or you are looking for more advanced content, "
"you may want to skip this section."

"CWL is a way to describe command-line tools and connect them together to "
"create workflows. Because CWL is a specification and not a specific piece"
" of software, tools and workflows described using CWL are portable across"
" a variety of platforms that support the CWL standard."

"The specification version can have up to three numbers separated by `.`s "

"that are backward-compatible. The last number is used for bug fixes, like"
