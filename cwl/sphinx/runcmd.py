""""
Patched version of https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/sphinxcontrib-runcmd
with default values to avoid having to re-type in every page. Also
prepends commands with a value (``$``), see https://github.com/invenia/sphinxcontrib-runcmd/issues/1.
Finally, it also checks if the command is ``cwltool``, and if then
tries to remove any paths from the command-line (not the logs).
